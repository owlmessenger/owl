# Contacts

Owl supports a synchronized contact list similar to other services.
Users can add arbitrary data and see it replicated to other devices.

Contacts also serve an important purpose within Owl, which is to map peers to real-world identities.
A contact should map to a persona that the user knows in real life.
A contact shoul also map to one persona which does not share any peers with the local persona.
